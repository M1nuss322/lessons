						present-day Ukraine, Belarus and the western part of European Russia.[40]
						According to the Primary Chronicle, the Rus'
						people initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia.[41] In 882, the
						pagan Prince Oleg (Oleh) conquered Kyiv from Askold and Dir and proclaimed
						it as the new capital of the Rus'.[42] Anti-Normanist historians however
						argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the Dnieper
						River were already in the process of forming a state independently.[43]
						The Varangian elite, including the ruling Rurik dynasty, later assimilated
						into the Slavic population.[40] Kievan Rus' was composed of several
						principalities ruled by the interrelated Rurikid kniazes ("princes"), who
						often fought each other for possession of Kyiv.[44]
					</p>
					<p class="block3__text2">
						During the 10th and 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and
						most
						powerful state in Europe, a period known as its Golden Age.[45] It began
						with the reign of Vladimir the Great (980–1015), who introduced
						Christianity. During the reign of his son, Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054),
						Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military
						power.[40] The state soon fragmented as the relative importance of
						regional
						powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of Vladimir II
						Monomakh (1113–1125) and his son Mstislav (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally
						disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav's death,
						though ownership of Kyiv would still carry great prestige for decades.[46]
						In the 11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the
						Turkic-speaking Cumans and Kipchaks was the dominant force in the Pontic
						steppe north of the Black Sea.[47]

						Kyiv in 1240, the city was destroyed by the Mongols.[48] In the western
						territories, the principalities of Halych and Volhynia had arisen earlier,
						and were merged to form the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia.[49] Daniel
						of
						Galicia, son of Roman the Great, re-united much of south-western Rus',
						including Volhynia, Galicia, as well as Kyiv. He was subsequently crowned
						by a papal envoy as the first king of Galicia–Volhynia (also known as the

							class="block4__text-link">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>.[51] From the

						colonies on the northern coast of the Black Sea and transformed these into
						large commercial centres headed by the consul, a representative of the
						Republic.[52] In 1430, the region of Podolia was incorporated into Poland,
						and the lands of modern-day Ukraine became increasingly settled by
						Poles.[53] In 1441, Genghisid prince Haci I Giray founded the Crimean
						Khanate on the Crimean Peninsula and the surrounding steppes;[54] the
						Khanate orchestrated Tatar slave raids. Over the next three centuries, the

						In 1569, the Union of Lublin established the Polish–Lithuanian

						Ruthenia converted to Catholicism and joined the circles of the Polish
						nobility; others joined the newly created Ruthenian Uniate Church.[57]

						In 1596, the Brest Union formalised the transition of the Ukrainian lands
						from Orthodox to the Catholic faith. The era of the feudal division of
						Poland and Lithuania, the period of the Ruin, began. The Ukrainian nobles
						were granted full rights among the elite of the Polish–Lithuanian
						Commonwealth for their military contributions.[58] The Cossacks, however,
						were rebelling against the Polish nobility, who were now the ruling class,
						because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish

							Khmelnytsky suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Berestechko in

							alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Russian

							Hetmanate. The Treaty of Perpetual Peace between Russia and Poland in

							After the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 1783, the newly acquired

							near
							the newly discovered coal fields of the Donbas, and in some larger cities

							into emigration, who created the backbone of an extensive Ukrainian
							diaspora in countries such as Canada, the United States and Brazil.[75]
							Some of the Ukrainians settled in the Far East, too. According to the
							1897

							Central Asia.[76] An additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the

							At the start of the 20th century, an estimated 80% of the population of

							brought a rapid growth of the working class and a large Russian-speaking
							urban population, which began to move into the Ukrainian-populated
							territories. The Ukrainian language was restricted in every possible way,
							from schools to printing to religious life. The Russian Empire managed to
